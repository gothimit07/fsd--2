// Write a Node.js program using the events module to simulate a sequence of events: 

// When a "connection" event occurs, print "Connection successfully" and trigger a "data-received" event.

// When the "data-received" event occurs, print "Data received successfully".

// Finally, print "Thanks" at the end of execution.
